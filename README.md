 Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript<br/>
 This user friendly weather application has a simple design to better display the user's weather forecast. Using Javascript fetch() API I was able to access data from openweather API which is on display in this beautifully built UI. The focus was to accessing data from the API and using that to display users weather forecast based on their exact position using javasript's geolocation.

<div id="header" >
 <h1 class="heading-element" dir="auto">Optimizations:</h1>
 I would improve the ability to search for state of the city and add more data to increase user experience. Improve UI background changes with the weather for the area. Focus on a mobile approach using react native.

  When fetching data from API copy object first to notepad only call when needed. When using weather API account for daylight/savings time.
